## Development

Last Newbie challenge from Frontend Mentor!

Let me tell you something - this didn't feel newbiew level at all :) 

First of all, I'd like to mention that the ideas for the animations came from [ApplePieGiraffe](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/ApplePieGiraffe). He's a brilliant developer and has built some incredible projects that you have to check out and see for yourself just how awesome his work is. 

After seeing his Meet landing page design, I tried to implement a similar animation in my own project. Truth be told, I stumbled across his solution months ago and I thought I could never achieve anything quite like that. In the end, my curiosity and desire to experiment and build new things, led me to attempt implementing this type of scroll-based animation.

I've spent around 10 hours working on this project. The design itself was finished in around 2 hours. The rest of the time I spent on implementing the GSAP animations and making adjustments to the code.

This was my first time using GSAP on such a large scale and there are definitely more improvements that can be done to the GSAP implementation and to the code itself.

For the time being, the animations are only available on the larger screen sizes as there are some visual bugs on the smaller screen sizes. 

Despite it being quite a difficult project, it was incredibly fun. If you haven't used GSAP before, I recommend you give it a shot. You can build a lot of amazing stuff with it and truly unleash your creative potential.
